## Summary
There are several packages out there for parsing of command-line arguments, but not one of them fulfills everything I like to see in such a library. So I just created another one ;-)

So what are these requirements?

* populates POCOs
* is not dependent on attributes (sorry, personally I find attributes, especially those with parameters, create a lot of noise when reading code)
* deals with verbs, like git, and nested verbs, too
* allows passing arguments by index, by long name and by short name
* produces good-looking and useful help
* possible to work with just the POCOs and not further configuration - for small in-house tools one often doesn't want to spend a lot of time with setting up these options
* good defaults, but at the same time configurable and extensible

## Quick Start
